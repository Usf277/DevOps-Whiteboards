Welcome to the **DevOps Whiteboards** repository! 🎯

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

Each whiteboard in this repo is designed to give you a clear and structured overview of a specific DevOps concept. So far, I've covered:

✅ **Process Management (Managing Linux Processes)**  
✅ **Git Version Control**  
🛠 **Docker & Containers** *(Next topic!)*

## 🤔 Why Whiteboard Notes?

I tend to explore multiple topics at once, which often leads to **information overload**. To stay focused, I started using **whiteboard summaries** to visualize everything in one place, connect concepts, and see the bigger picture. It turned out to be super effective! So, I decided to share my learning process. 🎯
